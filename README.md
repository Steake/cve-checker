# 🕵️‍♂️ CVE PoC Tracker

> _Because staying ahead of the curve is too mainstream_

A minimalist, terminal-inspired dashboard for tracking the latest Proof of Concept exploits from the underground (aka GitHub and GitLab). Built with SvelteKit and wrapped in a retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time PoC aggregation from multiple sources
- Cyberpunk-inspired terminal UI
- CVSS severity ratings with fancy tooltips
- Blazingly fast™ search and filtering
- Fully responsive, because exploits should be accessible everywhere

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

We believe security tools should look like they're straight out of a William Gibson novel. That's why we've gone with:

- Monospaced everything (Courier Prime, because we're fancy)
- Terminal-inspired color scheme
- Minimalist yet functional UI
- Smooth micro-interactions

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- SvelteKit (because React is too corporate)
- Artisanal hand-crafted CSS
- Free-range API integrations
- Locally-sourced JavaScript modules
